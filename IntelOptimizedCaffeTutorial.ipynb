    "While this tutorial uses Intel Optimized Caffe, the same general techniques apply to other frameworks like MXNet, Neon, Theano, Torch, TensorFlow, etc. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) is a deep learning framework written in C++ and CUDA C++ developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)). Intel Optimized Caffe is kept in synched with Caffe and therefore has all the benefits of Caffe. In addition, Intel Optimized Caffe is integrated with the latest release of Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) 2017 optimized for deep learning primitives on EC2 CPU instances. In addition Intel Optimized Caffe can be used for distributed multinode training or fine-tuning across various nodes. A tutorial for AWS distributed training can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/distributed-training-of-deep-networks-on-amazon-web-services-aws).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we go through the steps of installing Intel Optimized Caffe and BVLC Caffe, comparing performance on Intel Optimized Caffe vs BVLC Caffe, and fine-tuning a model. I'll explain what is fine-tuning below. A detailed explanation of installing and using Intel Optimized Caffe can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/training-and-deploying-deep-learning-networks-with-caffe-optimized-for-intel-architecture).\n",
